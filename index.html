                KATHMANDU, March 24: Majority of commercial banks have lowered their base interest rates on loans to single digit after they were overwhelmed with excess loanable funds.

                According to the financial reports unveiled by the class A financial institutions, 17 out of 20 commercial banks have maintained their interest rates on loans below 10 percent per annum. Three commercial banks including Kumari Bank, Prime Commercial Bank and Himalayan Bank, however, are found reluctant to reduce their base interest rates to single digit. The base interest rate of Himalayan Bank is the highest at 10.10 percent per annum.

                The notable drop in the interest rates has come after Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) became lenient in the issue through the first review of the monetary policy for 2023/24 in the first week of December. The NRB reduced the bank rate from 7.5 percent to 7 percent, while the policy rate was also revised to 5.5 percent from 6.5 percent.

                Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the su's activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. <a href="./topstories.html"> <span class="climate_read" id="climate_read">Read more...</span></a>

                Global markets today: After closing out its worst week since early December 2022, US stocks witnessed some bottom fishing and finished higher on Monday session. However, this rise in equities can be attributed to the profit booking by investors in US dollar as Dollar Index came below 105 on Monday.
